The entire code heavily relies on Tailwind CSS utility classes to achieve its styling. Instead of writing custom CSS, I applied these utility classes directly to HTML elements. 
This approach makes it easier for me to create consistent and responsive designs, as the classes are designed to work well together and handle various screen sizes.
